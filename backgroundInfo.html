					<h2>Background Information of Hong Kong and Singapore</h2>
					<div class="underTitle"></div>
					<h3><img src="image/Hong Kong/P3030667.JPG" alt="" width="190" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px;">Hong Kong</h3>
					<p>According to hkmemory.hk, Hong Kong was full of factories during the 60s and 70s. That was when they continued their development and the expansion of manufacturing that began in the previous decades. At that time, as long you worked hard, you would be rewarded. Therefore, the people in Hong Kong worked hard for living and work-life balance was not emphasised. Since all people thought was to work hard in order to earn their living, no one thought of the importance of free time.</p>
					<h3><img src="image/Singapore/P3231559.JPG" alt="" width="190" style="float: right; marign-left: 15px; overflow: auto;">Singapore</h3>
					<p>Singapore was founded on June 3, 1953, 111 years later than Hong Kong. When Hong Kong was on the manufacture stream during the 60s and 70s, Singapore was a developing city. However, it still underwent a rapid industrialization and maintained exceptionally high growth rates between 1960 to 1990s. Therefore, work-life balance couldnâ€™t be taken seriously at that place either. People had to work hard in order to have high growth rates back then. </p>
					<h3>Both cities</h3>
					<p>Both cities are part of the Four Asian Tigers (also known as Four Asian Dragons or Four Little Dragons), which means that their economies are outstanding among other regions in Asia. The cities' economies had grown a lot between 1960 (mid 1950 for Hong Kong) to 1990. As mentioned above, with this huge amount of growth, citizens would have to work hard in order to have this satisfying result. As a result, their resting time, or the 'life' part in work-life balance is a lot less than working time. </p>

					<h2>Background Data</h2>
					<div class="underTitle"></div>
					<h3>OCED Better Life Index</h3>
					<p>The OCED Better Life Index is a international comparable measure of well-being in line with the recommendations of Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress also known as the Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi Commission. According to OCED Better Life Index, Hong Kong is ranked at 7th while Singapore is ranked at 6th. </p>
					<div class="belowheader"></div>
					<h3>Working hours</h3>
					<p>Working balance is related to working hours and resting hours. Therefore, we have found some researches stated that Hong Kong's working hours is 2606 hours per year while Singapore is only 2350 hours per year. Which means that Singapore's working hours is 256 hours less than Hong Kong's. </p>
					<div class="belowheader"></div>
					<h3>Paid holidays</h3>
					<p>As number of holidays also determines on how many time a person spends on resting or working. It has been stated that Singapore only has 11 days of paid holidays per year while Hong Kong has 17 days of paid holidays per year. </p>
