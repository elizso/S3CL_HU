					<h2>Hypothesis and Assumptions</h2>
					<div class="underTitle"></div>
					<p>Our hypothesis is that Hong Kong has a worse work-life balance than Singapore. According to our research, we find out that Singapore has fewer working hours and the percentage of Singapore people bringing their their work back home is less than the percentage of Hong Kong people bringing their work back home to complete. Therefore, we think that Hong Kong citizens will have less leisure time that Singapore which will affect the work-life balance. Also, there was an article written that Hong Kong has the worst work-life balance as the citizens has a long working hours, which can shows that the government pay less attention on work-life balance and it affect the working hours of the citizens, so we also think that Hong Kong may have fewer government facilitates which are related to work-life balance comparing to Singapore. . Therefore, this is only an assumption, and we figure out when asking people to finish up our surveys in both Singapore and Hong Kong. </p>
